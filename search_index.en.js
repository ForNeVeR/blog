article is part of F# Advent calendar in English 2017.\nIntroduction\nAvalonia is a cross-platform UI .NET framework inspired by WPF and built around XAML and bindings. Why use another UI framework, you would ask? F# already has solid WPF-based infrastructure: FsXAML, FSharp.ViewModule and pretty awesome Gjallarhorn.Bindable.WPF. There is also F# support in Xamarin which allows you write UI applications for mobile devices.\nBut what if you need to build a cross-platform desktop applicaton (not Windows-only as in case of WPF)? Maybe you also want to use the modern .NET Core platform? Run the same UI code on mobile devices? Avalonia for the rescue!\nLet's start\nOK, let's start with an empty console .NET Core application. I usually use .NET Core CLI and wonderful Ionide extension for code editing (thanks a lot Krzysztof!). Works like a charm.\n$ mkdir avalonia-fsharp-example\n$ cd avalonia-fsharp-example\n$ dotnet new console -lang f#\n\nThen add Avalonia packages to the project.\n$ dotnet add package Avalonia\n$ dotnet add package Avalonia.Desktop\n\nAll native dependencies for your platform will be installed automagically.\nThen you need to create the core of our application and initialize Avalonia. Create two files:\n// App.fs\nnamespace AvaloniaFsharpExample\n\nopen Avalonia\nopen Avalonia.Markup.Xaml\n\ntype App() =\n    inherit Application()\n    override this.Initialize() =\n        AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this)\n&lt;!-- AvaloniaFsharpExample.App.xaml --&gt;\n&lt;Application xmlns=\"https://github.com/avaloniaui\"&gt;\n  &lt;Application.Styles&gt;\n    &lt;StyleInclude Source=\"resm:Avalonia.Themes.Default.DefaultTheme.xaml?assembly=Avalonia.Themes.Default\"/&gt;\n    &lt;StyleInclude Source=\"resm:Avalonia.Themes.Default.Accents.BaseLight.xaml?assembly=Avalonia.Themes.Default\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/Application.Styles&gt;\n&lt;/Application&gt;\n\nHopefully you remember how to use OOP features in the F#! App type is the core of the application -- subtype of Avalonia's Application class. Avalonia uses XAML files for UI design: controls, windows, styles and bindings. In 2017, XAML may look a little clunky, but I still found it very convenient for UI design and especially if you already familiar with WPF or Xamarin. So you need to override Initialize method and load App.xaml file containing style settings for our application:\nAvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this)\n\nIt loads an appropriate .xaml for our type. I'll describe how it works in the next section. For now you need to create main window of the application.\nIn the main window, we are going to show a classical \"hello world\" text. Let's design it!\n&lt;!-- AvaloniaFsharpExample.MainWindow.xaml --&gt;\n&lt;Window xmlns=\"https://github.com/avaloniaui\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        Title=\"AvaloniaFsharpExample\"&gt;\n    Hello World from Avalonia and F#!\n&lt;/Window&gt;\n\nYou also need to load the XAML file into the application:\n// MainWindow.fs\nnamespace AvaloniaFsharpExample\n\nopen Avalonia.Controls\nopen Avalonia.Markup.Xaml\n\ntype MainWindow () as this =\n    inherit Window()\n\n    do this.InitializeComponent()\n    member this.InitializeComponent() =\n        AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this)\n\nThe logic is the same as for App.fs -- we're loading a XAML file during the type initialization. Final step required to unite all the parts of the application is to write a proper entry point:\n// Program.fs\nopen System\nopen Avalonia\n\nopen AvaloniaFsharpExample\n\n[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]\nlet main argv =\n    AppBuilder.Configure&lt;App&gt;()\n        .UsePlatformDetect()\n        .Start&lt;MainWindow&gt;()\n    0\n\nJust as simple as \"configure app using appropriate backend and then start with MainWindow\". What does mean \"backend\"? At the lowest level, Avalonia uses different subsystems to work with windows and draw controls on them. Those parts are platform specific, but backend can be automagically detected. You can read more about Avalonia's architecture in the documentation (a little outdated).\nSay hello\nSo, can we finally run the application? Not yet. AvaloniaXamlLoader that we see before in the App and MainWindow types requires our XAML files to be placed in the binary resource section. To do that, we should to add &lt;EmbeddedResource&gt; items to our project:\n  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;\n    &lt;EmbeddedResource Include=\"AvaloniaFsharpExample.MainWindow.xaml\"&gt;\n      &lt;LogicalName&gt;AvaloniaFsharpExample.MainWindow.xaml&lt;/LogicalName&gt;\n    &lt;/EmbeddedResource&gt;\n\n    &lt;EmbeddedResource Include=\"AvaloniaFsharpExample.App.xaml\"&gt;\n      &lt;LogicalName&gt;AvaloniaFsharpExample.App.xaml&lt;/LogicalName&gt;\n    &lt;/EmbeddedResource&gt;\n  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\n\nIn the resource section, these names should be formated as [namespace].[type].xaml, e.g. AvaloniaFsharpExample.MainWindow.xaml. It seems on Windows and MacOS resource embedding behaviours are different, so you need use both explicit file name and LogicalName in project (I'm going to create issue about it).\nAnd don't forget to add source code files into project. Remember about the files order!\n&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\n    &lt;Compile Include=\"MainWindow.fs\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Compile Include=\"App.fs\" /&gt;\n    &lt;Compile Include=\"Program.fs\" /&gt;\n&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\n\nFinally we can run it!\n$ dotnet run\n\nYou will see the following window:\n\nPlease note if you're MacOS user you need to install gtk+3 via brew. It seems this issue is fixed in the nightly build of Avalonia.\n\nVisual designer\nIf you're a Visual Studio user, you will probably like Avalonia for Visual Studio extension. It contains visual designer for Avalonia XAML similar to WPF XAML designer.\nUnfortunately, according to this issue, XAML designer doesn't yet work on pure .NET Core applications. Therefore, to make it work, you need to add .NET Framework target to our fsproj.\n&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;netcoreapp2.0;net461&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;\n\nMake sure that you use TargetFramework_s_. Then open project with Visual Studio and you will see following:\n\nThat's also possible because of hard work of Visual F# contributors and MSFT team. Thanks you guys!\nConclusion\nHope you enjoyed this introductory blog post. What's next? Please check this article by Reed Copsey about functional MVU approach for Avalonia.\nYou can find code in repository.\nI also want to say thanks to Avalonia team for great job.\n","id":"https://gsomix.github.io/blog/01-say-hello-to-avalonia/","title":"Say hello to Avalonia"},"https://gsomix.github.io/blog/02-shortest-intro-to-compiler-design/":{"body":"Authors: Peter Sovietov, Evgeniy Andreev\nThis article is part of F# Advent calendar in English 2018. You may find original article in Russian with Python examples here.\nIntroduction\nLet's build a compiler of arithmetic expressions in F#. The compiler should translate source code in Reverse Polish notation (RPN) into intermediate representation (IR) suitable for a stack machine. However, we're not going to build an IR interpreter as you might think. We are going to translate IR right into C language code!\nSyntactic analysis\ntype IR =\n    | Push of int\n    | Op of string\n\nlet scan (source: string) =\n    let tokens = source.Split ' '\n    [ for tok in tokens -&gt; \n        match Int32.TryParse tok with\n        | true, num -&gt; Push num\n        | _ -&gt; Op tok  \n    ]\n\nWhat've we done here? The scan function takes a line from the user in RPN, e.g. 2 2 +. Basically it is both lexer and parser of our compiler. There are various approaches: lexer and parser might be separated (e.g. generated by FsLex and FsYacc) or joined (e.g. implemented with parser combinators library, FParsec). Output of the scan function is IR, a list of stack machine operations modeled with discriminated union:\n[ Push 2; \n  Push 2; \n  Op \"+\"\n]\n\nOK, this is already a working compiler, just not a serious one. For example, we can push incorrect operations onto the stack, so we need to introduce another discriminated union (like IR) for the operations possible in our compiler. Let's leave that as an excersise. Recall that we are going to generate C code as output!\nTranslation into C code\nlet trans (ir: IR list) =\n    [ for instr in ir do\n        match instr with\n        | Push value -&gt; \n            yield sprintf \"  st[sp] = %d;\" value\n            yield \"  sp += 1;\"\n        | Op op -&gt; \n            yield sprintf \"  st[sp - 2] = st[sp - 2] %s st[sp - 1];\" op\n            yield \"  sp -= 1;\" \n    ] |&gt; String.concat \"\\n\"\n\nWhat's going on? The trans function uses pattern matching to translate a list of IR instructions into C code. Pattern matching is a very convenient feature for compiler implementation. Let's see output for the 2 2 + expression.\n  st[sp] = 2;\n  sp += 1;\n  st[sp] = 2;\n  sp += 1;\n  st[sp - 2] = st[sp - 2] + st[sp - 1];\n  sp -= 1;\n\nThe st array is our stack, sp is a pointer to the last element of the stack. What's left? We need some additional C code for compilation by real C compiler.\nOur first compiler\nLet's just put all things together:\nopen System\n\nlet [&lt;Literal&gt;] ST_SIZE = 100\nlet [&lt;Literal&gt;] C_CODE = \"\"\"#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n  int main(int argc, char** argv) {{ \n  int st[{0}], sp = 0;\n{1}\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", st[sp - 1]);\n  return 0;\n}}\"\"\"\n\ntype IR =\n    | Push of int\n    | Op of string\n\nlet scan (source: string) =\n    let tokens = source.Split ' '\n    [ for tok in tokens -&gt; \n        match Int32.TryParse tok with\n        | true, num -&gt; Push num\n        | _ -&gt; Op tok  \n    ]\n\nlet trans (ir: IR list) =\n    [ for instr in ir do\n        match instr with\n        | Push value -&gt; \n            yield sprintf \"  st[sp] = %d;\" value\n            yield \"  sp += 1;\"\n        | Op op -&gt; \n            yield sprintf \"  st[sp - 2] = st[sp - 2] %s st[sp - 1];\" op\n            yield \"  sp -= 1;\" \n    ] |&gt; String.concat \"\\n\"\n\nlet rpnToC (source: string) = \n    let code = source |&gt; scan |&gt; trans\n    String.Format(C_CODE, ST_SIZE, code)\n\nprintfn \"%s\" (rpnToC \"2 2 + 3 -\")\n\nThe rpnToC function is our compilation pipeline. Literally! What's the output?\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n  int st[100], sp = 0;\n  st[sp] = 2;\n  sp += 1;\n  st[sp] = 2;\n  sp += 1;\n  st[sp - 2] = st[sp - 2] + st[sp - 1];\n  sp -= 1;\n  st[sp] = 3;\n  sp += 1;\n  st[sp - 2] = st[sp - 2] - st[sp - 1];\n  sp -= 1;\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", st[sp - 1]);\n  return 0;\n}\n\nLet's talk a little bit about the result. It's weird that our compiler can translate only constant expressions. Clearly, we can compute it right in the compile-time, no need to translate it at all. But consider that some arguments can come into stack from the outside. e.g. from command line arguments. OK, let's stop here. We can add command line processing to our implementation later. For now it's more important to understand compiler design at a high-level.\nSSA form\nStatic single assignment form sounds important for every compiler developer. What it is?\nFor now the compiler generates plain C code without any need of the virtual machine. But why do we need to generate code working with the stack in the runtime? Let's replace the stack array with plain variables. For every expression we will introduce a new one, and every variable should be assigned just once. Just no need to skimp on names. :)\nAnd... this is SSA form! Our new compiler:\nopen System\nopen System.Text\n\nlet [&lt;Literal&gt;] C_CODE = \"\"\"#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {{\n{0}\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", {1});\n  return 0;\n}}\"\"\"\n\ntype IR =\n    | Push of int\n    | Op of string\n\ntype Env = {\n    stack: string list\n    nameCounter: int\n}\n\nlet emptyEnv = { stack = []; nameCounter = 0 }\n\nlet scan (source: string) =\n    let tokens = source.Split ' '\n    [ for tok in tokens -&gt; \n        match Int32.TryParse tok with\n        | true, num -&gt; Push num\n        | _ -&gt; Op tok  \n    ]\n\nlet trans (ir: IR list) =\n    let transInstr (env: Env, code: StringBuilder) = function\n    | Push value -&gt; \n        let code = code.AppendLine (sprintf \"  int t%d = %d;\" env.nameCounter value)\n        let stack = (sprintf \"t%d\" env.nameCounter) :: env.stack\n        { env with stack = stack; nameCounter = env.nameCounter + 1}, code\n    | Op op -&gt; \n        let (leftOperand :: rightOperand :: stack) = env.stack\n        let code = code.AppendLine (sprintf \"  int t%d = %s %s %s;\" env.nameCounter rightOperand op leftOperand)\n        let stack = (sprintf \"t%d\" env.nameCounter) :: stack\n        { env with stack = stack; nameCounter = env.nameCounter + 1}, code\n\n    ir |&gt; List.fold transInstr (emptyEnv, StringBuilder())\n\nlet rpnToC (source: string) = \n    let env, code = source |&gt; scan |&gt; trans\n    String.Format(C_CODE, code, env.stack.Head)\n\nprintfn \"%s\" (rpnToC \"2 2 + 3 -\") \n\nPlease pay attention that there is no stack in the produced C code. The stack processing performs in the compile-time. This is our internal stack for variables' names (not values as in the previous version):\ntype Env = {\n    stack: string list\n    nameCounter: int\n}\n\nlet emptyEnv = { stack = []; nameCounter = 0 }\n\nThe processing of the stack can be modeled through folding. This is a standard way in FP to perform statefull operations:\nlet trans (ir: IR list) =\n    let transInstr (env: Env, code: StringBuilder) = function\n    | Push value -&gt; (* ... *)\n    | Op op -&gt; (* ... *)\n\n    ir |&gt; List.fold transInstr (emptyEnv, StringBuilder())\n\nThere is also some non-safe code:\nlet (leftOperand :: rightOperand :: stack) = env.stack\n\nIt fails when stack contains not enough elements. Clear error messages are another excersise for the reader. Compilation errors are very important part of the compiler!\nFinal output:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n  int t0 = 2;\n  int t1 = 2;\n  int t2 = t0 + t1;\n  int t3 = 3;\n  int t4 = t2 - t3;\n\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", t4);\n  return 0;\n}\n\nIt seems like a good start for a more complicated compiler, right? We can go with stack languages like Forth, Postscript, Joy or Factor. Even statically typed functional language can be stack-based! Obviously another way is to increase syntax complexity. But let's leave all these questions for later posts.\nWe wish you success in compiler design.
